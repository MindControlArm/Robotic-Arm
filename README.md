Robotic-Arm
===========

This repository contains some of the final code used at the TOM (Tikkun Olam Makeathon) 2014 as part of the group "Mind control platform"

The AccessibleRemote directory contains the Android source code for the "AccessibleRemote" software, which was used to control the robotic hand and the camera mount. The Android phone was connected via a USB cable to an Arduino ADK.

The assets directory contains the files used in the demo of controlling the robot arm from the Android phone. After running the app once, the files should all be placed in the directory:
/Android/data/com.curiousjason.accessibleremote/files/maps/

For any questions about the software, please contact Jason Friedman (write.to.jason@gmail.com)
